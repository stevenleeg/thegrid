    <h2>the developer(s)</h2>
    <p>The Grid is a game designed and developed by <a href="http://stevegattuso.me">Steve Gattuso</a>. At this point everything you see has been created by me.</p>
    <p>Dedicated server hardware has also been graciously donated by <a href="http://jamesanderson.me">James Anderson</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>technical stuff</h2>
    <p>This game was originally a fun side project for a simple idea I had. Its main goal was to help me learn about emerging web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, and WebSockets). For this reason, the game is mostly incompatible with any non-recent browsers.</p> 
    <p>The server side is written using <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> and the wonderful realtime library: <a href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a>. It also uses <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> for a persistant database backend.</p>

    <h2>interested?</h2>
    <p>If you're interested in helping out, I'd love an extra developer on the project. I'm currently looking for anyone with HTML, JS/jQuery, and especially Python. Feel free to contact me if you have any desire in assisting with development. I can't promise any sort of reward at this time, but I can definitely say it's an awesome learning experience.</p>
