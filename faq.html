    <div class="answer" id="when">When will the full game be released?</div>
    <p>This is undecided at the moment. Right now we're focusing on development more than timelines. For the latest information, <a href="http://twitter.com/thegridsays">follow us on twitter</a>.</p>

    <div class="answer" id="how">How will I play the game?</div>
    <p>The game is completely browser based. To play, just point your browser at the URL!</p>

    <div class="answer">What browsers are supported?</div>
    <p>Many cutting-edge web technologies are used throughout the game, therefor thegrid will most likely not run on anything but a recently updated browser. We only test on and officially support <a href="http://chrome.google.com">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Apple Safari</a>.
